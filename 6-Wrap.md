Now I'd like to get a bit meta and talk about this talk. As mentioned, when I
came up with the talk, it was a little gimmick and a fairly important topic.

When I went to write it, though, I had to contend with some hard questions.

For example, I shared my deadname with you all today, which is a deeply
personal choice. I want to be clear: I do not use that name anywhere it is not
strictly required. I can count on one hand the number of people at my work who
know what my deadname is.

I discussed my experiences, challenges, and successes that are important to me.

I can do all of this because this community feels safe. I feel I can bare these
parts of myself without danger to myself, and that's an important quality in a
community.

Thank you, and I will now open for questions. There are topics I will choose to
not speak about, but please don't worry about your question being too simple,
or possibly being unsure if it would offend me. I will recuse myself from
answering, but at least offer some guidance on how you could get insight into
the question.
