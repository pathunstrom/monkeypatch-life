A note about the topic of this talk: I am not covering Gender 101 and Trans theory 101. If you're not sure what makes a person transgender or how any of this
works, I'm not going to be explaining it here.

Additionally, I'm going to be talking about my experiences with gender in my
community and this is not the only trans story out there. Please see Naomi
Ceder's talk on this topic to hear another view.

Trans people aren't a monolith, and our experiences are not universal. Please
do not take my stories and advice as the _only_ available story. I even have an
example where things that are best for people like myself, make things
challenging for other minority communities.
