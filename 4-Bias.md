In the intervening years, I leveled up, improving my skills as a developer, and
ending up in a few more shops where I got to experience the social aspects of
gender in ways most people don't think about.

It's been proven time and again that women's contribution to software is more
heavily scrutinized than men's when the gender is known.

This was a stumbling block that developed in my career, which is an interesting
experience. It was most apparent in a project for one of my companies that
started at about 100 lines of code, including tests, and then became a six week
morass with almost every other developer on the team expressing concerns at
design and ballooning the scope to over 1000 SLOC and making a simple task a
very complex one.

Now, none of my team was openly bigoted, and I don't think anyone, including
the leadership, expected what happened. This is a real thing that happens with
real people, where subtle biases create friction that costs real time for
everyone involved.

Simply be aware of these subtle biases. They're hard to be rid of, and to fix
them you need to actively work to avoid them.
