Over the next few years I leveled up improved my skills as a developer and
got into a few more development shops where I got to experience the social
aspects of gender in ways most people don't think about.

It's been proven time and again that women's contribution to software is more
heavily scrutinized than men's when the gender is known.

This was a stumbling block that developed in my career, which is an interesting
experience. Now it doesn't come out all at once, and it's not universal, but
over time my work was getting judged at a higher and higher level, but the
things I was criticized on changed a bit.

It was most apparent in a project for one of my companies that started at 
about 100 lines of code, including tests. It was a simple model for our system
and requires very little design time. Over the next few weeks, though, almost
every developer on the team had some complaint about it and that 100 lines of
code swelled to almost 1000 and included a new cacheing layer and threading
capabilities. Our post mortem found that PR to have the most comments on a
single piece of work out of any of the things I helped build there.

Now, none of my team was openly bigoted, and I don't think anyone, including
the leadership, expected what happened. This is a real thing that happens with
real people, where subtle biases create friction that costs real time for
everyone involved.

Simply be aware of these subtle biases. They're hard to be rid of, and to fix
them you need to actively work to avoid them.
