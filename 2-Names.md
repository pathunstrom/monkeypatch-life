This story starts with another me. I joined a group known as the New York
City Python Meetup. I was encouraged to submit a proposal for a little event
we know as PyGotham.

I gave that talk and it's still available on the web.

Not long after, I started to transition.

It started with a name. Unfortunately, we learn quickly that names aren't
nearly as simple as we'd hope. And way more difficult that renaming things in
Python.

If anyone has ever read the article "falsehoods programmers believe about
names", #7 on the list is 'People's names do not change' followed by 'people's
names change, but only at certain enumerated set of events.'

These ideas are incredibly common: it's demonstated in the "real name" policies
of Google and Facebook and Blizzard. It often requires proof of "legal" name
changes which are difficult and often expensive. And in the real world, lots
of people don't use their "legal" names in day to day life.

The good news is, when I came out to the organizers of PyGotham and the Python
Meetup group, the first question I got asked was "Should we change the names
on your videos?"

As you saw, I didn't do that, but it was great first signal that I was in a
good community.

The take away here is very simple: Names change. What you consider a canonical
name will often not be "canonical" the one you're applying it to. We need to
make systems where names can change easily, and don't rely on them as the only
point of identification.

What's worse, is it costs our communities talent. I have a friend who refuses
to contribute to open source projects she's interested in, because the last
time she did was under a different name she doesn't want to be associated with
anymore, and our VCS systems don't actually have a way of fixing that.
