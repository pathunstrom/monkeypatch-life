This story starts with another me. I joined a group known as the New York
City Python Meetup. I was encouraged to submit a proposal for a little event
we know as PyGotham.

I gave that talk and it's still available on the web.

Not long after, I started to transition.

It started with a name. Unfortunately, we learn quickly that names aren't
nearly as simple as we'd hope. And way more difficult that renaming things in
Python.

If anyone has ever read the article "falsehoods programmers believe about
names", #7 on the list is 'People's names do not change' followed by 'people's
names change, but only at certain enumerated set of events.'

These ideas are incredibly common, demonstated in Google and Facebook and even
Blizzard's Battlenet. "Real name" policies that are incredibly difficult to
change.

The good news is, when I came out to the organizers of PyGotham and the Python
Meetup group, the first question I got asked was "Should we change the names
on your videos?"

As you saw, I didn't do that, but it was great first signal that I was in a
good community.

The immediate next thing I was told was if I was given any trouble to let the
organizers know.
