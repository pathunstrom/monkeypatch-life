One of the things you learn as a trans person is that social gender is both
way simpler than most of us assume, but is built into a very complex social
system.

As time went on and I became more entwined with the New York Python Meetup
Group I became fairly recognized person in the community, and led a number of
discussions on various topics. This was exciting, and went well.

This was during what I consider a kind of messy part of my transition. I was
visibily transgender. This isn't a bad thing, but it creates situations that
can be tense.

One day, during one of our study groups, there was a circle discussion, with a
mix of new members of the group and longer term members. One woman turned to me
in the middle of the conversation and asked what my pronouns were.

I want to be clear: If you're unsure what pronouns to use for a person, it is
absolutely best practices to ask!

In this case though, this question stopped a conversation and effectively
confirmed I was trans to strangers. I have a number of horrifying stories 
that start with a stranger asking me if I'm a man or a woman. One of them on
the subway platform just one stop away. Being outed publicly is a very real
threat for trans people.

Now, this kind of threat is reduced if your community has a culture of
including pronouns in introductions and on name badges. It's cheap, it's easy,
and it helps so many people.

In addition, if you need to ask (and let's be real: You're going to need to ask
a lot more than you think) please do it privately, so as not to embarrass and
out your community members.
